# FS25_AnimalHerdingLite

AnimalHerding - Lite mod for FS25 by Arrow. Contains the base herding feature of AnimalHerding without more advanced features that are still in development/theoretical. Advanced features include customised animal behaviour, animations, nav mesh and path finding to replace the base engine behaviour. This requires the majority of the animal system to be written from scratch with 0 reference code for the most part, as such code is obfuscated within the engine. AnimalHerding is well in development but still not in a playable state. When complete, this will allow for more dynamic animal interactions such as dynamic milking parlours, individualised animal behaviour (limping, friendly, cowardly, escape artist etc) and more.

# Features
- Button to toggle herding in the current husbandry
- When on, all animals in the husbandry will be herdable
- Herdable animals respond to the player and will walk/run away from the player when the player is close, otherwise will graze/idle randomly
- Herdable animals will be added into a husbandry when they walk into range of it (ie: walking into its fenced area) and will no longer be herdable
